# JNetMan:
This the JNetMan project, a Java framework for effortless development of SNMP-based, proactive, network management applications.

JNetMan was born as a research project developed within a cooperation program between ANTLab (Politecnico di Milano) and LORLAB (GERAD, École Polytechnique de Montréal).

The author and current maintainer is Carmelo Cascone, you can drop him a line at carmelo [dot] cascone [at] gmail [dot] com

# Rationale:
This project was initiated by the need to manage network devise in a fairly exotic use case.

The purpose of jNetMan is to offer an open architecture and a set of libraries (API) for the remote management of network devices using the SNMP protocol. By offering an high-level abstraction of the network topology and MIB-specific management operations, jNetMan can be used used as a base for the development of more specific management applications.
