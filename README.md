# Rationale:
------------
This project was initiated by the need to manage network devise in a fairly exotic use case.

The purpose of jNetMan is to offer an open architecture and a set of libraries (API) for the remote management of network devices using the SNMP protocol. By offering an high-level abstraction of the network topology and MIB-specific management operations, jNetMan can be used used as a base for the development of more specific management applications.
